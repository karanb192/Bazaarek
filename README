This repository consists of (currently) two main folders:
1. Modules
2. Themes

These are the two main places where developers and designers can modify the software.

For conformity, install the lampp stack on your system with the prestashop addon from bitnami (installed seperately).

Go online and fork this repository to your Github account: https://github.com/Bazaarek/Bazaarek.git

After doing the abovementioned steps, create a bash shell script with the following code and run it.

#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
cd /opt/lampp/apps/prestashop/
sudo git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Bazaarek.git
sudo cp -r Bazaarek/* htdocs
sudo cp -r Bazaarek/.git htdocs
sudo rm -rf Bazaarek
clear
echo "Successfully initialised git version control in your Bitnami-LAMPP-Prestashop Enviroment."

Setting up Git Remote

1. Use the following command on terminal.
	sudo git remote add upstream https://github.com/Bazaarek/Bazaarek.git
2. Everyday, before working. Get the latest code from the repository with the following.
	sudo git pull upstream master

Pulling new updates

1. Use the following code.
	sudo git pull --rebase origin master

With these steps your own development environment would function properly. You may begin developing modules and customising themes.

Keep the following things in consideration:
1. Learn about all the technologies which will be utilised in this project.
2. Try not to commit broken code.
3. Never send pull requests for non-working code to the main repository.
4. Periodically update your work from the main repository and always keep the most updated.
